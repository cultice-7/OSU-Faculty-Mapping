Topic,Theme,Notes
Energy Storage,Energy Technologies,We aren't interested in the R&D; we are interested in taking things to market that are ready to commercialize or to put into a pilot.
emissions detection and monitoring,Environmental Technologies and Systems,Related to JadeTrack monitoring project. What might be other ways that we can add value to customers by tracking/monitoring emissions on their behalf?
Energy Integrated modeling,Environmental Technologies and Systems,
Land Use and Solar,Environmental Technologies and Systems,We've seen some interesting work that The Nature Conservancy is doing around solar siting.
