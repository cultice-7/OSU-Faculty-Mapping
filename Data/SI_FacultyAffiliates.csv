My work covers the arc of environmental inequality from an investigation into its political causes to its ultimate consequences of social disparities in health outcomes. At the foundation of my work is a perspective that scholars need to bring the insights from the field of sociology to bear on the causes of environmental risk and resulting effects on health. Current research provides little doubt that pollution is unequally distributed by race and class. Future research in this field needs to work toward gaining insight into actionable social and political areas that are at the core of these inequalities.

While this is particularly evident in environmentally compromised communities, very little is known about how non-chemical stressors and exposures from the natural, built, physical, and social environment, coupled with individual behavioral and inherent characteristics, propagate the effects of chemical exposures on the lifetime progression of disparate cardiovascular health outcomes in African American women. My current projects employ the Warnecke model and the Public Health Exposome framework (PHE) to advance our understanding of associations between a combination of chemical and non-chemical stressors, personal characteristics, and CVD risk among vulnerable populations. In a multilevel manner, studies in my current projects integrate data from several research projects to estimate the cumulative risk for subclinical CVD development as a function of exposure to chemical and non-chemical stressors. The modeling approaches we employ are predictive for phenotypes of resilience and CVD risk trajectories.

As a faculty member in the Department of Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering and a Faculty co-lead for Healthy Land and Water Systems in the OSU Sustainability Institute, he seeks to use natural systems to improve water quality and increase sustainability. His interdisciplinary research links field studies, watershed models, and socio-economic analyses with stakeholder groups to investigate connections between downstream water quality and management practices in upstream watersheds. Currently, Dr. Martin is leading a $5M USDA-NIFA project to establish a Public-Private Partnership with crop consultants and farmers, to identify fields with elevated nutrient levels where management practices will be installed and monitored in an effort to reduce nutrient runoff. He is also leading an interdisciplinary research team to evaluate the impacts of a large green infrastructure project, ""Blueprint Columbus,"" on water, communities, ecosystems, economics and public health within the City of Columbus. Outside of Ohio, Dr. Martin's other research has included Mayan agroecosystems in southern Mexico, biodigesters in Costa Rica, Andes wetlands in Colombia, and the use of algae as a soil amendment by O'ahu farmers in Hawaii. As of 2019, he has published over 70 peer-reviewed articles, successfully advised over 35 Graduate Students and Post Docs, and been awarded more than $17M to support his research program. He is certified as a Senior Ecologist by the Ecological Society of America and a registered Professional Engineer in Ohio.
